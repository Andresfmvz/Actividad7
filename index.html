    <p class="text1">Law On Time is a conglomerate of volunteering lawyers with a <b>strong</b> sense of justice and social 
        equality. Our mission is to help those who cannot defend themselves and have suffered from unfair 
        treatment by big corporations or even federal institutions. Historically, lawyers picked up cases 
        based on personal gain and completely forgot about their role in society, turning the judicial 
        system into a profitable business. Our firm prioritizes justice and resolution, and our lawyers are 
        willing to go the extra mile to achieve success.<br><br>
        We all remember the cases from 2017 in which corrupted judges made unfair decisions based on their 
        own personal experiences instead of the evidence, these were national news as those actions revived 
        the old struggles not just by minorities, but by common citizens to be heard and to be fairly 
        treated</p>
